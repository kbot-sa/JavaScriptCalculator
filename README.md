# JavaScriptCalculator

This project is from a tutorial that I completed: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j59qQ7YWLxw&list=PLZlA0Gpn_vH8DWL14Wud_m8NeNNbYKOkj&index=2

It covers making a calculator using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Instead of using math libraries all operations are done manually, as well as, number delimiters and formatting.
